so i rebuild the docker image of this project by typing docker build -t amateur3639/utkarsh-personal:version-name and then i 
ran docker login to login to my dokcer GitHu
-> then i did this to tag my docker hub file to this docker ->docker tag amateur3639/utkarsh-personal amateur3639/utkarsh-personal:latest

tag works like we are using alias for the image name before pushing it to docker hub and would use the same name as we used during tagged name for the above case we would use utkars-personal:latest
